### Programming Problem Notes

Including this readme for practice.

For the counting and probability problems, look at counting.pdf and probability.pdf

For wordle and schedwork, go to the respective test directories in hw5_tests and run make and then run the executable 

Everything should compile and run smoothly. Wordle runtimes are around 100000ms which isn't too bad. Schedwork should run smoothly.

All tests should pass.

Thank you for stopping by. Enjoy!
